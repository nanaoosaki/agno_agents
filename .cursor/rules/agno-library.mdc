For any Agno API or feature mentioned, search the organized docs/agno/ folder first and include the exact file reference. If not found, say "I can't verify".

Use docs/agno/ as the authoritative reference for Agno APIs and code patterns. This folder contains the complete Agno documentation organized by topic:
- docs/agno/index.md - Main index of all sections
- docs/agno/quick_reference.md - Common patterns and APIs
- docs/agno/knowledge/ - Chunking strategies, embedders, knowledge bases
- docs/agno/core/ - Agent creation, sessions, basic APIs
- docs/agno/tools/ - ReasoningTools and other tool integrations

When you generate code, include a brief comment with the file path you followed from docs/agno/.
