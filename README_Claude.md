## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This repository contains a sophisticated health companion AI system built on the Agno framework, designed to provide intelligent health logging, analysis, and coaching capabilities. The system has undergone comprehensive development and architectural refinement, evolving from a monolithic structure to a clean, layered architecture that supports multi-modal interactions and intelligent agent orchestration.

## 🎯 **System Overview**

The Health Companion consists of multiple specialized AI agents working in concert to provide:

- **Multi-Modal Health Logging** - Voice, text, and image input processing
- **Historical Data Analysis** - Pattern recognition and correlation studies  
- **Evidence-Based Coaching** - Safe, non-medical guidance grounded in knowledge bases
- **Intelligent Routing** - Context-aware orchestration between specialist agents
