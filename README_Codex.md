## Repository Overview

This project implements an intelligent, multi-modal health management system using the Agno framework. It combines multiple specialist agents orchestrated by a router to log health episodes, recall historical information, and provide evidence-based coaching. The system focuses on migraine and chronic pain management while remaining extensible to other conditions.

## Key Components

- **Health Logger v3.1:** Extracts structured data from text, voice, and image inputs with deterministic processing and JSON storage.
- **Recall Agent:** Answers historical health queries through time-aware search and correlation analysis.
- **Coach Agent:** Delivers safe, empathetic guidance grounded in a migraine knowledge base with guardrails and fallback strategies.
- **Router Agent:** Routes user requests to specialist agents using multi-intent classification and confidence thresholds.
- **Unified Multi-Modal Interface:** Gradio UI accepts combined text, voice, and file inputs for coherent logging and analysis.

## Documentation Highlights (`docs/Linda`)

Implementation reports under `docs/Linda` provide detailed technical breakdowns:

- `architecture_refactor_report.md` – Transformation from monolithic structure to layered architecture with shared primitives and abstract storage.
- `healthlogger_agent_implementation_report.md` – Pure Agno workflow resolving episode fragmentation and introducing deterministic processing.
- `recall_agent_implementation_report.md` – Smart toolkit design enabling time-range parsing, episode filtering, and correlation analysis.
- `coach_agent_implementation_report.md` – Knowledge-grounded coaching agent using ChromaDB and safety guardrails.
- `router_agent_implementation_report.md` – Stateful orchestrator supporting multi-intent routing and confidence-based fallbacks.
- `multimodal_health_logger_implementation_report.md` – Extension of Health Logger for image processing with secure file handling.
- `unified_multimodal_implementation_report.md` – Unified UI flow combining text, voice, and file inputs in a single submission.

These documents chronicle design decisions, technical steps, and testing outcomes for each major feature.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` and configure OpenAI API keys.
2. Run the Gradio application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Interact with the "Health Companion (Auto-Router)" agent for comprehensive health management.

## Testing

Execute the test suite with:
```bash
pytest
```
