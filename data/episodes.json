I woke up at 3 a.m., went to bed at 9 p.m., and stayed up for probably two hours or so, and then fell back to sleep and got up at 7 a.m. And then I did heat therapy to relax the neck, but the left scapula pain is still there. It's the day 4. I feel like it's less, so I would give it a pain level of 2. And then I had breakfast, which is one cup of cashew gold cereal, one cup of 1% milk, one cup of blueberries, and two slices of whole wheat bread. And then I did a ring fit exercise between 9, 10 a.m. to 9, 30 a.m., 20 minutes."
