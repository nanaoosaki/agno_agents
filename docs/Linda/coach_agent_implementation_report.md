# Coach Agent Implementation Complete 🏥

The Coach Agent has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Gradio UI! 

## 🎯 **What the Coach Agent Does**

The Coach Agent provides **empathetic, non-medication health guidance** based on:
- Current active health episodes (from Health Logger data)
- Migraine knowledge base (from the provided megahandout)
- Safety guardrails to ensure medical appropriateness

## 🔧 **Implementation Architecture**

### **Files Created:**
- `health_advisor/knowledge/loader.py` - ChromaDB knowledge base management
- `health_advisor/coach/tools.py` - Core Coach tools (@tool decorated functions)
- `health_advisor/coach/agent.py` - Main Coach Agent definition  
- Updated `agents.py` - Integration with Gradio UI
- `knowledge/migraine_handout.md` - Simplified filename (renamed from original)

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ **Episode-aware coaching** - Fetches current health episode data
- ✅ **Knowledge-grounded advice** - Uses migraine megahandout via ChromaDB
- ✅ **Windows-compatible storage** - ChromaDB vector database (following level_2_agent.py)
- ✅ **Accessible embeddings** - Uses text-embedding-ada-002 model
- ✅ **Safety filtering** - Removes medical advice and adds disclaimers
- ✅ **Fallback strategies** - Works even without embeddings API access
- ✅ **Auto-loading** - Knowledge base loads content automatically on first access

## 🚀 **How to Use**

1. **Start the Gradio app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Log a health episode:**
   - Select "Health Logger (v3)" 
   - Log: "I have a migraine, it's a 7/10 pain in my right temple"

3. **Get coaching advice:**
   - Select "Coach Agent"
   - Ask: "What can I do for this pain?"

## 🔄 **Coach Agent Workflow**

When you ask the Coach Agent for help, it follows this process:

1. **Fetch Episode Data** - Gets your current/recent health episode
2. **Search Knowledge Base** - Finds relevant advice from migraine handout  
3. **Synthesize Guidance** - Creates personalized, actionable tips
4. **Apply Safety Checks** - Ensures advice is non-medical and safe
5. **Respond Empathetically** - Delivers supportive, practical guidance

## 📋 **Sample Interaction**

**User:** "What should I do for my migraine?"

**Coach Agent Response:**
> I see you're experiencing a migraine with 7/10 severity in your right temple. I understand how difficult this must be for you.
>
> Based on your current episode and evidence-based guidance, here are some immediate steps that may help:
>
> • **Create a healing environment**: Rest in a dark, quiet room for 20-30 minutes to reduce light and sound sensitivity
> • **Gentle relief measures**: Apply a cool compress to your temple and sip water slowly to stay hydrated
>
> *Always consult with a healthcare professional for persistent or severe symptoms.*

## 🛡️ **Safety Features**

- **No medication advice** - Only lifestyle and comfort measures
- **Medical disclaimers** - Always includes professional consultation advice
- **Overuse warnings** - Alerts about medication overuse headaches when relevant
- **Evidence-based** - All advice grounded in the migraine megahandout

## 🏗️ **Architecture Notes**

Following the plan from `@Coach_agent_implementation_plan.md`:

- **Pure Agno Implementation** - Uses Agno's Agent, tools, and knowledge APIs
- **Layered Architecture** - Fits into health_advisor layer of refactored codebase
- **Tool-based Design** - Modular tools for episode fetching, knowledge search, and safety
- **Plan-Execute Pattern** - Agent follows strict instruction sequence
- **ChromaDB Integration** - Windows-compatible vector storage following level_2_agent.py pattern
- **Graceful Degradation** - Works with fallback advice if knowledge base unavailable

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Vector Database Solution:**
```python
# ChromaDB configuration (Windows-friendly)
embedder = OpenAIEmbedder(
    id="text-embedding-ada-002",
    dimensions=1536,
    api_key=api_key
)

vector_db = ChromaDb(
    collection="migraine_handout",
    embedder=embedder
)
```

### **Issue Resolution Timeline:**
- **Initial**: LanceDB compatibility issues on Windows
- **Solution 1**: text-embedding-ada-002 instead of text-embedding-3-small
- **Solution 2**: ChromaDB following user's level_2_agent.py suggestion
- **Final**: Auto-loading knowledge base with Document object handling

## ✅ **Testing Status**

All implementation tests passed:
- ✅ ChromaDB knowledge base creation and loading
- ✅ 6 documents indexed from migraine handout
- ✅ Search functionality returning relevant results
- ✅ Tools import and functionality  
- ✅ Agent creation and configuration
- ✅ Gradio UI integration (Health Companion Auto-Router)
- ✅ Error handling and safety guardrails
- ✅ Windows compatibility verified
