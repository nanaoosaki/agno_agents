Of course. The analysis provided is excellentâ€”it correctly identifies the subtle but critical gaps in the initial Recall Agent plan. The suggestions (especially around date parsing, explicit correlation logic, and query planning) are key to building a robust, production-ready agent.

This revised plan incorporates that feedback directly into an Agno-native architecture. We will stick with the single-agent-with-a-toolkit pattern, but we'll make the toolkit significantly smarter and more deterministic, and we'll refine the agent's instructions to encourage a "plan-then-execute" behavior.

Revised Implementation Plan: The Agno Recall Agent (v3.1)
Core Strategy: An Intelligent Agent with a Deterministic Toolkit

The agent's role is to understand the user's natural language question and break it down into a logical plan. The toolkit's role is to execute that plan against the stored data with robust, predictable functions that handle the messy details of dates, normalization, and aggregation.

Step 1: Enhance the Schema & Rules

Before building the tools, we need to refine our data contracts and rules to support the advanced logic.

File: healthlogger/schema.py

Add Pydantic models for the structured outputs of our new tools. This ensures type safety and traceability.

# healthlogger/schema.py
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import List, Optional

# ... (keep existing models) ...

class TimeRange(BaseModel):
    start_utc_iso: str
    end_utc_iso: str
    label: str # e.g., "last 7 days", "yesterday"

class EpisodeSummary(BaseModel):
    episode_id: str
    condition: str
    started_at: str
    max_severity: Optional[int]
    interventions: List[str]

class CorrelationDetail(BaseModel):
    observation_timestamp: str
    matched_episode_id: str
    hours_difference: float

class CorrelationResult(BaseModel):
    observation_total: int
    episodes_with_correlation: int
    correlation_found: bool
    details: List[CorrelationDetail]
    conclusion: str

File: healthlogger/rules.py

Ensure your normalize_condition function is robust and can be imported by the new toolkit.

Step 2: Build the Smart RecallToolkit

This toolkit will contain the deterministic functions that perform the actual data retrieval and analysis. These tools are designed to be called by the agent in a sequence.

from agno.agent import Agent
from .. import storage, rules
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List, Optional

# Use a library for robust date parsing
import dateparser

from .schema import TimeRange, EpisodeSummary, CorrelationResult, CorrelationDetail

@tool
def parse_time_range(agent: Agent, query: str, user_timezone: str = "UTC") -> TimeRange:
    """
    Parses a natural language query to identify a time range (e.g., 'last week', 'yesterday', 'since August 1st').
    Returns a structured start and end time in UTC ISO format. This should be the first step in any historical query.
    """
    # In a production app, you might use a more robust date parsing library or a dedicated LLM call.
    # For now, we can use dateparser.
    now = datetime.now()
    if "last week" in query.lower():
        end_date = now
        start_date = now - timedelta(days=7)
        label = "the last 7 days"
    elif "yesterday" in query.lower():
        start_date = now - timedelta(days=1)
        end_date = start_date
        label = "yesterday"
    else: # Default to last 7 days if no specific range is found
        end_date = now
        start_date = now - timedelta(days=7)

        end_utc_iso=end_date.isoformat(),
        label=label
    )

@tool
def find_episodes_in_range(agent: Agent, condition: str, start_date_iso: str, end_date_iso: str) -> List[EpisodeSummary]:
    """
    Finds episodes for a given condition within a specific UTC date range.

    """
    normalized_condition = rules._normalize_condition(condition) # Reuse normalization logic
    # ... (Implementation to filter episodes.json by date range and normalized condition)
    # This should return a list of EpisodeSummary objects.
    return [] # Placeholder

@tool
def correlate_observation_to_episodes(agent: Agent, observation_keyword: str, condition: str, start_date_iso: str, end_date_iso: str, window_hours: int = 24) -> CorrelationResult:
    """

    within a given time range and window.
    """
    # ... (Implementation for the robust correlation logic as described in the plan)
    # 1. Find all observations matching `observation_keyword` in the date range.
    # 2. For each observation, check if a `condition` episode occurred within `window_hours`.
    # 3. Count total observations and correlated episodes.
    # 4. Return a structured CorrelationResult.
    return CorrelationResult(
        observation_total=0,
        episodes_with_correlation=0,
        correlation_found=False,
        details=[],
        conclusion="Not enough data to determine a correlation."
    )
Step 3: Define the RecallAgent

This agent is the brain. Its instructions will guide it to use the new toolkit in a logical, planned sequence.

code
Python

content_copy

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END
# healthlogger/recall/agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from .tools import parse_time_range, find_episodes_in_range, correlate_observation_to_episodes

recall_agent = Agent(
    name="RecallAgent",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[
        parse_time_range,
        find_episodes_in_range,
        correlate_observation_to_episodes,
    ],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    instructions=[
        "You are a health data analyst. Your job is to answer questions about a user's health history using the provided tools.",
        "CRITICAL: You MUST follow a logical plan. For most questions, the plan is:",
        "1. First, call `parse_time_range` to understand the time period the user is asking about (e.g., 'last week', 'yesterday').",
        "2. Next, use the date range from step 1 to call either `find_episodes_in_range` for simple counts or `correlate_observation_to_episodes` for correlation questions.",
        "3. Finally, synthesize the structured data from the tools into a clear, empathetic, and concise answer.",
        "If a tool returns no results, you MUST inform the user you don't have enough data. DO NOT HALLUCINATE.",
        "Always present the conclusion from the `CorrelationResult` tool directly to the user when answering correlation questions."
    ]
)```

### **Step 4: Integrate into the Main `agents.py`**

This step remains the same as the previous plan: we simply add the new, more powerful `RecallAgent` to our UI's dropdown list.

**File**: `agents.py`

```python
# agents.py
# ... (existing code)

from healthlogger.recall.agent import recall_agent

# --- Add a wrapper class for the Recall Agent ---
class RecallAgentWrapper:
    name = "Recall Agent"
    def run(self, prompt: str, files: Optional[list] = None) -> ChatResult:
        response = recall_agent.run(prompt)
        return ChatResult(text=response.content)

# --- Update the Agent Registry ---
AGENTS: Dict[str, Any] = {
    "Health Logger (v3)": HealthLoggerWorkflowWrapper(),
    "Recall Agent": RecallAgentWrapper(), # This now points to our new agent
    # ... other agents
}
How This Plan Addresses the Gaps:

Dates & Timezones: Handled by the dedicated parse_time_range tool.

Condition Normalization: Addressed by reusing the rules._normalize_condition function within the tools.

Correlation Logic: The correlate_observation_to_episodes tool now has a clear mandate to calculate and return explicit counts, with a structured CorrelationResult output.

Traceability: The new Pydantic models (EpisodeSummary, CorrelationDetail) include IDs and timestamps, making the agent's reasoning auditable.

Query Planning: This is now explicitly encoded in the RecallAgent's instructions, forcing a logical sequence of tool calls.

Edge Cases: The agent is instructed on how to handle empty tool results, preventing hallucinations.

This revised plan provides a robust, testable, and Agno-native implementation for your Recall Agent, directly incorporating the expert feedback you received.
