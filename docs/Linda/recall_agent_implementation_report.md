## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **1. Schema Enhancement (`healthlogger/schema.py`)**

**Purpose:** Extend existing schemas with Recall-specific models

**New Models Added:**
```python
class TimeRange(BaseModel):
    start_utc_iso: str  # UTC ISO format dates
    end_utc_iso: str   
    label: str         # Human-readable description

class EpisodeSummary(BaseModel):
    episode_id: str
    condition: str
    started_at: str
    max_severity: Optional[int] = None
    interventions: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)

class CorrelationResult(BaseModel):
    observation_total: int
    episodes_with_correlation: int
    correlation_found: bool
    details: List[CorrelationDetail]
    conclusion: str
```

### **2. Smart Toolkit (`healthlogger/recall/tools.py`)**

**Purpose:** Deterministic functions for data retrieval and analysis

**Following:** `docs/agno/tools/writing_your_own_tools.md` patterns

**Tool 1: `parse_time_range`**
```python
@tool
def parse_time_range(agent: Agent, query: str, user_timezone: str = "UTC") -> TimeRange:
    # Enhanced natural language date parsing
    # Supports: "last week", "yesterday", "last month", "today", etc.
    # Returns structured TimeRange with ISO dates
```

**Tool 2: `find_episodes_in_range`** 
```python
@tool
def find_episodes_in_range(agent: Agent, condition: str, start_date_iso: str, end_date_iso: str) -> List[EpisodeSummary]:
    # Condition normalization using CONDITION_FAMILIES
    # Date range filtering with proper ISO parsing
    # Episode summarization with interventions
```

**Tool 3: `correlate_observation_to_episodes`**
```python
@tool
def correlate_observation_to_episodes(agent: Agent, observation_keyword: str, condition: str, 
                                    start_date_iso: str, end_date_iso: str, 
                                    window_hours: int = 24) -> CorrelationResult:
    # Keyword matching in observations
    # Time window correlation analysis 
    # Statistical summary with detailed findings
```

### **3. Recall Agent (`healthlogger/recall/agent.py`)**

**Purpose:** Orchestrate tools with intelligent planning

**Model:** `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` (per `@openai-model-list.mdc`)

**Key Instructions:**
```python
instructions=[
    "You are a health data analyst specialized in analyzing historical health patterns and correlations.",
    "CRITICAL: You MUST follow a logical plan for every query:",
    "1. ALWAYS START with `parse_time_range` to understand the time period",
    "2. CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL based on the question type:",
    "   - For simple counts/lists: use `find_episodes_in_range`", 
    "   - For correlation questions: use `correlate_observation_to_episodes`",
    "3. SYNTHESIZE the structured data into a clear, empathetic response"
]
```

**Critical Design Features:**
- **Plan-Execute Pattern** - Forces logical tool sequencing
- **Question Type Recognition** - Routes to appropriate analysis tool
- **Empathetic Communication** - Health-sensitive response generation
- **Data Integrity** - No hallucination, explicit data limitations

### **4. UI Integration (`agents.py`)**

**Purpose:** Seamless integration with existing Gradio interface

**Wrapper Pattern:**
```python
class RecallAgentWrapper:
    name = "Recall Agent"
    description = "Analyzes historical health data patterns and correlations using intelligent querying"
    
    def run(self, prompt: str, files: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> ChatResult:
        # Standard ChatResult format for UI compatibility
        # Error handling and metadata preservation
```

---

## 🔄 **Data Flow & Workflow**

### **Query Types Supported**

**1. Episode Count Queries:**
```
Input: "Did I have any migraines last week?"
Flow: parse_time_range("last week") → find_episodes_in_range("migraine", dates) → summary
Output: "You had 2 migraine episodes last week, with severities of 6 and 8..."
```

**2. Correlation Queries:**
```
Input: "Does eating cheese trigger my migraines?"
Flow: parse_time_range("recent history") → correlate_observation_to_episodes("cheese", "migraine") → analysis  
Output: "I found 3 observations of cheese consumption. 2 were within 24 hours of migraine episodes..."
```

**3. Historical Summaries:**
```
Input: "Show me my pain episodes from yesterday"
Flow: parse_time_range("yesterday") → find_episodes_in_range("pain", dates) → detailed summary
Output: "Yesterday you had 1 pain episode: a back pain episode that started at 2 PM..."
```

### **Data Processing Logic**

**Condition Normalization:**
- Reuses `CONDITION_FAMILIES` from Health Logger v3
- Maps user terms ("headache") to canonical conditions ("migraine")

**Time Window Correlation:**
- Default 24-hour window for observation-episode correlation
- Configurable window size for different analysis needs
- Bidirectional correlation (before and after observations)

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Count total observations matching keyword
- Count episodes with correlations within time window
- Calculate correlation rate and significance
- Generate evidence-based conclusions

## 🧠 **Core Logic & Algorithms**

### **Time Parsing Algorithm**

```python
def parse_time_range(query: str) -> TimeRange:
    now = datetime.utcnow()
    
    if "last week" in query.lower():
        return TimeRange(now - 7days, now, "the last 7 days")
    elif "yesterday" in query.lower():
        return TimeRange(start_of_yesterday, end_of_yesterday, "yesterday")
    elif "last month" in query.lower():
        return TimeRange(now - 30days, now, "the last 30 days")
    # ... more patterns
    else:
        return TimeRange(now - 7days, now, "the last 7 days (default)")
```

### **Correlation Algorithm**

```python
def correlate_observations_to_episodes(keyword, condition, window_hours=24):
    # 1. Find observations containing keyword in date range
    matching_observations = filter_observations_by_keyword(keyword, date_range)
    
    # 2. Find episodes of specified condition (extended range for window)
    condition_episodes = filter_episodes_by_condition(condition, extended_range)
    
    # 3. Calculate time differences and find correlations
    correlations = []
    for obs in matching_observations:
        for episode in condition_episodes:
            time_diff = abs(obs.timestamp - episode.started_at).hours
            if time_diff <= window_hours:
                correlations.append(CorrelationDetail(...))
    
    # 4. Generate statistical summary
    return CorrelationResult(
        observation_total=len(matching_observations),
        episodes_with_correlation=len(unique_episodes_correlated),
        correlation_found=len(correlations) > 0,
        conclusion=generate_evidence_based_conclusion(...)
    )
```

### **Agent Planning Logic**

## 🔧 **Critical Bug Fix Report**

**Fix Date:** August 16, 2025 09:53 UTC  
**Issue Reporter:** User feedback on missing 2025-08-15 episode  
**Severity:** High - Core functionality impacted

### **Issue Analysis**

**Problem:** Recall Agent failed to find episode from 2025-08-15 when user queried "show me the pain episodes from yesterday"

**Investigation Results:**
1. **Episode Exists:** `ep_2025-08-15_migraine_4868be11` with condition `"migraine"` at `2025-08-15T19:36:59.321604`
2. **Date Range Correct:** Yesterday parsing worked correctly (`2025-08-15T00:00:00` to `2025-08-15T23:59:59.999999`)
3. **Two Root Causes Identified:**

### **Root Cause 1: Tool Function Testing Issue**
- **Problem:** `@tool` decorated functions became `agno.tools.Function` objects, not directly callable
- **Error:** `'Function' object is not callable`
- **Impact:** Prevented debugging and testing of tool logic

### **Root Cause 2: Semantic Condition Mismatch**
- **Problem:** User searched for "pain" but episode was categorized as "migraine"
- **Behavior:** Strict condition matching only found exact matches
- **Impact:** Missed clinically related conditions that users would expect to find

### **Solutions Implemented**

**Fix 1: Enhanced Testability Architecture**
```python
# Added non-decorated core functions for testing
def _parse_time_range_core(query: str, user_timezone: str = "UTC") -> TimeRange:
    # Core logic without @tool decorator

def _find_episodes_in_range_core(condition: str, start_date_iso: str, end_date_iso: str) -> List[EpisodeSummary]:
    # Core logic with semantic expansion

@tool
def parse_time_range(agent: Agent, query: str, user_timezone: str = "UTC") -> TimeRange:
    return _parse_time_range_core(query, user_timezone)  # Delegate to core
```

**Fix 2: Semantic Condition Expansion**
```python
def _get_related_conditions(condition: str) -> List[str]:
    normalized = _normalize_condition(condition)
    
    # Semantic expansion for "pain" searches
    if normalized == "pain":
        return ["pain", "migraine", "back_pain", "neck_pain"]
    
    return [normalized]
```

### **Validation Results**

**Test 1: Tool Function Testability** ✅ PASSED
- Non-decorated functions now callable for debugging
- Proper separation of core logic from Agno framework

**Test 2: Semantic Condition Matching** ✅ PASSED
- Query for "pain" now finds migraine episodes
- Maintains specificity for direct condition searches

**Test 3: Target Episode Discovery** ✅ PASSED
- `ep_2025-08-15_migraine_4868be11` now found by "pain episodes from yesterday"
- Date range filtering working correctly

### **User Experience Impact**

**Before Fix:**
```
User: "show me the pain episodes from yesterday"
Agent: "I'm sorry, but it seems that there were no recorded pain episodes for you yesterday."
```

**After Fix:**
```
User: "show me the pain episodes from yesterday"
Agent: "I found 1 pain-related episode yesterday: a migraine episode that started at 7:36 PM..."
```

### **Technical Improvements**

1. **Enhanced Condition Mapping:**
   - `"pain"` searches now include: `["pain", "migraine", "back_pain", "neck_pain"]`
   - Maintains medical accuracy while improving user experience
   - Preserves specificity for targeted searches

2. **Improved Tool Architecture:**
   - Core functions (`_*_core`) for logic implementation
   - Tool functions (`@tool`) as thin wrappers for Agno integration
   - Better separation of concerns and testability

3. **Robust Error Handling:**
   - Graceful fallback for unrecognized conditions
   - Improved debugging capabilities for future issues

### **Lessons Learned**

1. **Tool Testing Strategy:** Always provide non-decorated variants for debugging
2. **User Intent vs. Technical Categories:** Users think semantically, not in strict categories
3. **Condition Hierarchies:** Generic terms ("pain") should expand to specific conditions
4. **Validation Importance:** Real user scenarios reveal edge cases

### **Future Enhancements Identified**

1. **Advanced Semantic Mapping:** Machine learning for condition relationships
2. **User Preference Learning:** Remember user's preferred terminology
3. **Disambiguation UI:** When multiple condition types found, ask for clarification
