# Agentic Chunking
Source: https://docs.agno.com/reference/chunking/agentic



Agentic chunking is an intelligent method of splitting documents into smaller chunks by using a model to determine natural breakpoints in the text.
Rather than splitting text at fixed character counts, it analyzes the content to find semantically meaningful boundaries like paragraph breaks and topic transitions.
