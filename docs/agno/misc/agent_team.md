# Agent Team
Source: https://docs.agno.com/examples/getting-started/agent-team



This example shows how to create a powerful team of AI agents working together to provide comprehensive financial analysis and news reporting. The team consists of:

1. Web Agent: Searches and analyzes latest news
2. Finance Agent: Analyzes financial data and market trends
3. Lead Editor: Coordinates and combines insights from both agents

Example prompts to try:

* "What's the latest news and financial performance of Apple (AAPL)?"
* "Analyze the impact of AI developments on NVIDIA's stock (NVDA)"
* "How are EV manufacturers performing? Focus on Tesla (TSLA) and Rivian (RIVN)"
* "What's the market outlook for semiconductor companies like AMD and Intel?"
* "Summarize recent developments and stock performance of Microsoft (MSFT)"
