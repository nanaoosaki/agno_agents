# Human in the loop
Source: https://docs.agno.com/tools/hitl



Human in the loop (HITL) let's you get input from a user before or after executing a tool call.

The example below shows how to use a tool hook to get user confirmation before executing a tool call.

## Example: Human in the loop using tool hooks

This example shows how to:

* Add hooks to tools for user confirmation
* Handle user input during tool execution
* Gracefully cancel operations based on user choice

```python hitl.py
"""ü§ù Human-in-the-Loop: Adding User Confirmation to Tool Calls

This example shows how to implement human-in-the-loop functionality in your Agno tools.
It shows how to:
- Add tool hooks to tools for user confirmation
- Handle user input during tool execution
- Gracefully cancel operations based on user choice

Some practical applications:
- Confirming sensitive operations before execution
- Reviewing API calls before they're made
- Validating data transformations
- Approving automated actions in critical systems

Run `pip install openai httpx rich agno` to install dependencies.
