# Recipe Creator
Source: https://docs.agno.com/examples/agents/recipe-creator



This example shows how to create an intelligent recipe recommendation system that provides
detailed, personalized recipes based on your ingredients, dietary preferences, and time constraints.
The agent combines culinary knowledge, nutritional data, and cooking techniques to deliver
comprehensive cooking instructions.

Example prompts to try:

* "I have chicken, rice, and vegetables. What can I make in 30 minutes?"
* "Create a vegetarian pasta recipe with mushrooms and spinach"
* "Suggest healthy breakfast options with oats and fruits"
* "What can I make with leftover turkey and potatoes?"
* "Need a quick dessert recipe using chocolate and bananas"
