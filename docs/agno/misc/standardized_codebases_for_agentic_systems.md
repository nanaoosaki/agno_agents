# Standardized Codebases for Agentic Systems
Source: https://docs.agno.com/workspaces/introduction



When building an Agentic System, you'll need an API to serve your Agents, a database to store session and vector data and an admin interface for testing and evaluation. You'll also need cron jobs, alerting and data pipelines for ingestion and cleaning. This system would generally take a few months to build, we're open-sourcing it for the community for free.
