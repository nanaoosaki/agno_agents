# Stripe MCP agent
Source: https://docs.agno.com/examples/concepts/tools/mcp/stripe



Using the [Stripe MCP server](https://github.com/stripe/agent-toolkit/tree/main/modelcontextprotocol) to create an Agent that can interact with the Stripe API:

```python
"""ðŸ’µ Stripe MCP Agent - Manage Your Stripe Operations

This example demonstrates how to create an Agno agent that interacts with the Stripe API via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This agent can create and manage Stripe objects like customers, products, prices, and payment links using natural language commands.


Setup:
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install agno mcp-sdk`
3. Set Environment Variable: export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=***.
