# When to use a Workflow vs a Team in Agno
Source: https://docs.agno.com/faq/When-to-use-a-Workflow-vs-a-Team-in-Agno



Agno offers two powerful ways to build multi-agent systems: **Workflows** and **Teams**. Each is suited for different kinds of use-cases.

***

## Use a Workflow when:

You want to execute a fixed series of steps with a predictable outcome.

Workflows are ideal for:

* Step-by-step agent executions
* Data extraction or transformation
* Tasks that donâ€™t need reasoning or decision-making

***

## Use an Agent Team when:

Your task requires reasoning, collaboration, or multi-tool decision-making.

Agent Teams are best for:

* Research and planning
* Tasks where agents divide responsibilities

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

> Think of **Workflows** as assembly lines for known tasks,
> and **Agent Teams** as collaborative task forces for solving open-ended problems.
