# Why Agno?

Agno will help you build best-in-class, highly-performant agentic systems, saving you hours of research and boilerplate. Here are some key features that set Agno apart:

* **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
* **Highly performant**: Agents instantiate in **\~3Î¼s** and use **\~6.5Kib** memory on average.
* **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Reasoning improves reliability and is a must-have for complex autonomous agents. Agno supports 3 approaches to reasoning: Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `chain-of-thought` approach.
* **Natively Multi-Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi-modal, they accept text, image, audio and video as input and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
* **Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture (**Agent Teams**) with reasoning, memory, and shared context.
* **Built-in Agentic Search**: Agents can search for information at runtime using 20+ vector databases. Agno provides state-of-the-art Agentic RAG, **fully async and highly performant.**
* **Built-in Memory & Session Storage**: Agents come with built-in `Storage` & `Memory` drivers that give your Agents long-term memory and session storage.
* **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents can return fully-typed responses using model provided structured outputs or `json_mode`.
* **Pre-built FastAPI Routes**: After building your Agents, serve them using pre-built FastAPI routes. 0 to production in minutes.
* **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
