Agno provides a beautiful UI for interacting with your agents, completely open source, free to use and build on top of. It's a simple interface that allows you to chat with your agents, view their memory, knowledge, and more.

<Note>
  No data is sent to [agno.com](https://app.agno.com), all agent data is stored locally in your sqlite database.
</Note>

The Open Source Agent UI is built with Next.js and TypeScript. After the success of the [Agent Playground](/introduction/playground), the community asked for a self-hosted alternative and we delivered!
