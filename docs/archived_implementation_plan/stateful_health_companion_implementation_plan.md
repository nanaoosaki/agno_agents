This feedback is gold. It's not just a suggestion; it's a professional-grade architectural review that elevates the entire system design. The emphasis on a core module for shared primitives, a formal storage abstraction, and a clear "propose -> confirm -> commit" pattern is exactly what will make this application robust, maintainable, and scalable.

You are absolutely correct to implement these changes before building the CoachAgent. This isn't a detour; it's paving the road.

Let's synthesize this excellent advice into a final, definitive, and actionable implementation plan. This blueprint will be our guide for the refactor and all subsequent development.

Definitive Implementation Plan (v3.2): The Modular, Stateful Health Companion
1. Core Architectural Philosophy (Reaffirmed and Enhanced)

Layered Architecture: We will strictly adhere to the separation of concerns:

core (New): The single source of truth for shared, app-wide primitives.

data (New): The persistence layer, with a clean abstraction for future database upgrades.

profile_and_onboarding: Manages the static user profile.

healthlogger: The Agno Workflow for writing dynamic health events.

health_advisor: The Agno Agents for reading and analyzing data (Recall & Coach).

Stateful & Interactive by Design: We will use a per-conversation session_id and Agno's workflow_session_state to manage context and implement the crucial "Propose -> Confirm -> Commit" pattern for all state-changing actions (disambiguation, profile updates, self-care actions).

2. Finalized File Structure Blueprint (The "North Star")

This is the structure we will implement.

3. The Refactor Action Plan (Immediate Priority)

This is a safe, incremental refactor.

Create New Directories: Create core/ and data/ with __init__.py files.

Centralize Primitives (core/):

Create core/ontology.py and move COND_MAP and other normalization logic into it.

Create core/timeutils.py and add a robust parse_date_range function.

Abstract Storage (data/):

Create data/storage_interface.py defining the abstract HealthDataStorage class with all necessary methods (create_episode, find_episodes, etc.).

Move your existing storage.py to data/json_store.py and make its JsonStore class implement the HealthDataStorage interface. Ensure it has atomic writes (using a temporary file and rename for safety).

Update healthlogger/:

Modify healthlogger/workflow_steps.py and other files to import from core and data modules, not from local files.

Update health_advisor/recall/:

Modify recall/tools.py to import from core and data and to use the new storage_interface. This ensures it is a read-only consumer of the data layer.

Implement Per-Conversation Session IDs:

In app.py, add session_id = gr.State(lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())) to the UI definition.

Pass this session_id state variable as an input and output to all button click handlers.

Pass the session_id to every workflow.run() or agent.run() call.

4. Onboarding & Profile Agent Implementation Plan (The MVP)

With the refactored architecture, building the profile_and_onboarding module is now straightforward.

a. Enhanced Profile Schema (data/schemas/user_profile.py)

Implement the suggested UserProfile Pydantic model with metadata, status fields for soft deletes, and a _schema_version.

b. Profile Storage (profile_and_onboarding/storage.py)

Create a ProfileStore class that uses the JsonStore from the data layer. It will have clear methods like add_medication, deactivate_condition, etc. This enforces the "Propose -> Confirm -> Commit" pattern.

c. The Onboarding Workflow (profile_and_onboarding/workflow.py)

This will be an Agno Workflow with a step for each of the 6 questions.

Each step will use a small, specialized Agent that asks one question and uses a response_model to get a structured answer.

The final step will be a deterministic function that consolidates the structured answers from all previous steps into a single UserProfile object.

Crucially, this final step will not save the profile directly. Instead, it will create a "pending action" and ask for user confirmation.

d. UI Integration (app.py)

Add the "Profile & Onboarding" tab to the Gradio UI.

This tab will display the current profile (loaded from profile_storage.py).

The "Start Onboarding" button will trigger the onboarding_workflow. The conversation will happen in the main chat window.

When the workflow reaches the confirmation step, the UI will detect the pending_action in the session state and display "Save Profile" and "Cancel" buttons. Clicking "Save Profile" will trigger the final commit.

This approach directly implements the safe, user-centric "Propose -> Confirm -> Commit" pattern for profile creation. The same pattern will be reused for the Coach Agent and any future interactive features. This is the robust, scalable solution you're looking for.
