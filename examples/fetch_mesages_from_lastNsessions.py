# To enable fetching messages from the last N sessions, you need to use the following flags:
# search_previous_sessions_history: Set this to True to allow searching through previous sessions.
# num_history_sessions: Specify the number of past sessions to include in the search. In this example, it is set to 2 to include only the last 2 sessions. Itâ€™s advisable to keep this number to 2 or 3 for now, as a larger number might fill up the context length of the model, potentially leading to performance issues.
# These flags help manage the context length and ensure that only relevant session history is included in the conversation.
