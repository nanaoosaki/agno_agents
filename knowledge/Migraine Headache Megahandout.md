Migraine Headaches
Migraines afflict about 28 million people in the United States. Up to 6% of all men and 18% of all women (12%
of the population). Roughly 75% of migraine sufferers are women. Children also get migraine (5-10% of
children under the age of 18 years).
Most adults will experience a tension-type headache at some time during their lives. Tension-type headaches are
mild to moderate bilateral pressure or tightening.  The pain is not usually aggravated by routine activity and is
not associated with symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to light and noise.  Tension-type headaches are not
usually disabling. If you have frequent tension type headaches it is likely that you are also prone to migraines.
Many headache specialists believe that tension headaches and migraine don’t exist as discrete conditions but
form a continuum of the same entity.
Many blame their migraines on "sinus headache" due their frontal location.  Patients that present with recurrent
frontal headaches without infection usually have migraine.  Sinus headaches are typically associated with a
cloudy (not clear) nasal discharge. Sinus problems can act as a trigger in someone with a predisposition for
migraine.
Many people like to divide her headaches as "stress headaches", "hunger headaches" along with her migraines.
Like the example of the sinus headaches these are probably the triggers with underlying condition of the
migraine being the main problem
Classification Criteria for Migraine
A. At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D below
B. Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)

## C. Headache has at least two of the following characteristics:

1. unilateral location (Can be bilateral)
2. pulsating quality
3. moderate or severe pain intensity
4. aggravation by or causing avoidance of routine physical activity (eg, walking or climbing stairs)

## D. During headache at least one of the following:

1. nausea and/or vomiting
2. photophobia and phonophobia
E. Not attributed to another disorder
Migraine is triggered by a cascade of events that appear to be slightly different in different people. It is clear
that migraine is a biological disorder. The brain of a migraine patient is thought to be very sensitive to triggers
and environmental factors. Although it is not clear where or why it starts, some patients have a unique pattern of
activity that spreads across the outer layers of the brain. This activity is thought to be responsible for the aura
that about 30% of patients with migraine experience. The aura can be recognized as flashing lights, blurred
vision, numbness or tingling. Some people experience vertigo or speech difficulty. The actual pain in migraine
is thought to be caused by inflammation around the blood vessels that surround the outer layers of the brain. Up
to 70% of people report persistent symptoms for few hours to days after the headache including sensitivity to
light, lethargy, fatigue and inability to focus known as the "postdrome". Likewise, about 60% of people have a
period of difficulty concentrating, yawning fatigue sensitivity to light and noise lasting a few hours to days
before the aura and headache known as the "prodrome".

## Migraine Facts:

1. Migraine is a biological disorder.
2. Migraine is a disorder of the central nervous system
3. Migraine represents a hypersensitivity of the central nervous system to specific triggers and stimuli.
4. Migraine is genetic
5. There is no “cure” for migraine. While there is no cure we do have appropriate and effective treatment
options.

Headache Prevention
Triggers and Lifestyle
Whether or not you take preventive medications, you may benefit from lifestyle changes that can
help reduce the number and severity of migraines.  Simple things like changes to a normal routine
can lead to a severely disabling migraine attack.
It may be unrealistic to expect someone to completely change a certain lifestyle.  Certain things are

## relatively easy to do.  For example:


Maintain regular sleep patterns.  Go to sleep and wake up at about the same time each
day.

Eat regular meals.  Skipping meals and hunger can cause headaches

Avoid common triggers (see table on Common Triggers) such as foods, odors, and bright
lights.

Limit stress.  Avoid conflicts and try to resolve disputes calmly.

Try to quit smoking.  Smoking can trigger headaches or make headaches worse.

Exercise regularly.  Aerobic exercise for at least 30 minutes three times a week can help
reduce frequency and severity of migraine.  Warm up because sudden, intense exercise can
trigger a headache

Don't overuse your pain medications.  Using pain medications more than 2 days per
week will cause analgesic rebound headaches
Avoiding Triggers
"Triggers" are specific factors that may increase your risk of having a migraine attack.  The
migraine sufferer has inherited a sensitive nervous system that under certain circumstances, can
lead to migraine.
Triggers do not "cause" migraine.  Instead, they are thought to activate processes that cause
migraine in people who are prone to the condition.  A certain trigger will not induce a migraine in
every person; and, in a single migraine sufferer, a trigger may not cause a migraine every time.
You may want to keep a headache diary so that you will be able to identify some triggers for your
particular headaches. Once you have identified triggers, it will be easier for you to avoid them and
reduce your chances of having a migraine attack.
Stress and “Sinus” headaches
Many people blame their headaches on stress and sinus when they are actually migraine.  Stress
and sinus problems can be thought of as among many of the migraine triggers.
Obesity: People who are obese have 5 times greater risk for getting migraines.
Depression: People with depression have 3 times greater risk for getting migraines
Sleep apnea: People with poor sleep and sleep apnea have increased risk of headaches and
chronic migraine.

Migraine Preventative/Prophylactic Medication
People with regular or severe migraine attacks may benefit from taking medications on a
daily basis to prevent or reduce their headache frequency.  These medications are called
prophylactic or preventative medications.  They help reduce your headache sensitivity.
Another way of thinking about it is that they will raise the threshold at which you get a
headache. Prophylactic medications are not a cure. Abortive, as-needed medication will still
be necessary almost all patients.
Traditional migraine medication preventative therapies were originally developed for
other medical problems.  Through experience we have found that these medications are
helpful for migraines. These medications come from one of 3 major categories including
antihypertensives, anti‐seizure medications and antidepressants.  If we prescribe one of
these medications it does not mean that we feel that your headaches are due to hypertension,
seizures or depression.
The newest class of migraine preventative medication is the anti‐CGRP (calcitonin gene
related peptide) monoclonal antibodies. These are migraine specific medications given by
injection. They are touted as potentially reducing headache frequency by 50% in between
40-50% of people using them.  Since this is a new medication it is expensive and insurance
companies may require that you have tried and failed traditional therapy. Unlike
traditional medications these tend to have a more rapid onset of action.
Botox treatments are beneficial for people who have chronic migraines.  You have chronic
migraines if you're having headaches 15 days or more each month for 6 months or more.
Insurance companies require that you have tried and failed at least 2-3 traditional
therapies.
Guidelines

We try to pick a drug with the best efficacy and the fewest side effects

We try to take a drug that is least likely to interact with your other medications.

We initiate the chosen drug at a low dose and titrate up to an effective dose or until
there are side effects.

Note: It takes time for traditional migraine prophylactic to work.  While you may start
feeling benefit in 2‐3 weeks, a 2 to 3 month trial is often needed to assess the efficacy of
a treatment.

We often try to use a drug that may benefit any comorbid or coexisting conditions
the patient has.  For example the patient has hypertension we will use one of the
antihypertensives that is also beneficial for migraine.

The role of the anti-CGRP medications may change how we prescribe preventative
medications over time

Rebound Headaches (Medication Overuse Headache)
Overview
You feel a headache coming on, so you reach for a pain reliever. Or maybe you take pain medication in advance —
even every day — to stave off frequent headaches. After all, that's what pain relievers are for, right?
Think again.
Pain relievers offer quick relief for occasional headaches. But there's a limit. If you find yourself taking pain medication
more than two or three days a week, you may actually be contributing to your headaches rather than easing them.
It's a cycle known as rebound headaches.
The cycle starts when you take too much headache medication.  Soon, your body adapts to the medication and you
become dependent upon it. You may not even realize that you've been dosing yourself too often until you miss a day
and your head starts to hurt again.
The only way to stop rebound headaches is to reduce or stop taking the pain medication that's causing them.
Signs and symptoms
Rebound headaches, also called medication overuse headaches, tend to occur almost every day, sometimes
waking you in the early morning and continuing throughout the day. Sometimes, a rebound headache causes dull,
achy pain. In other cases, the pain is throbbing or pounding.  Other symptoms can include nausea, anxiety,
depression, memory problems and insomnia.  At times you may have your typical migraine symptoms such as nausea
and photosensitivity.
Causes
Overuse of nearly any pain reliever can contribute to rebound headaches. But some medications are more likely to
lead to rebound headaches than are others.

Simple pain relievers. Acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Even NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and Naprosyn
(Aleve) can contribute to rebound headaches if taken more than 10 days per month

Combination pain relievers are particularly likely to cause rebound. Over-the-counter pain relievers that
contain a combination of caffeine, aspirin and acetaminophen (Excedrin, others) are common culprits.

Prescription medications containing the sedative butalbital, acetaminophen and caffeine such as
Fioricet, Fiorinal and Esgic are extremely likely to cause rebound and are highly addictive.

Migraine medications.  Overuse of migraine medications including ergotamines and triptans such as
sumatriptan, Imitrex, Treximet, Maxalt and Relpax.

Opiates. Painkillers derived from opium or from synthetic opium compounds include combinations of
codeine and acetaminophen (Tylenol with Codeine No. 3 and No. 4, others).

Caffeine; from your morning coffee, your afternoon soda, or any pain reliever or other product containing
this mild stimulant.
How Much Medication Is Too Much?
For an episodic migraine condition to transform into a chronic one, medications need to be taken for only a modest
number of days per month: 5 to 10, depending on the type of medication.

A pivotal study found that butalbital combinations were most likely to cause medication overuse headache,
needing to be taken on merely 5 or more days per month.

Opioids caused it if taken 8 or more days per month.

Triptans if taken 10 or more days per month.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) actually protected against transformation to daily
headache if used 5 or fewer days per month, but caused medication overuse headache if used 10 or more
days per month.

Thus, there was a hierarchy of risk, with butalbital being the worst, opioids in the middle, and NSAIDs and
triptans the least risky.  Excedrin (aspirin and acetaminophen and caffeine) was not included in this study but
is frequently overused and is a common cause of rebound headaches.

Risk factors

Anyone who has a history of migraine headaches,

People with a of history of obesity, depression,  anxiety, smoking, physical inactivity and chronic GI and or
musculoskeletal complaints
Complications
Drug dependency may be a risk of any drug that results in rebound headaches. Excessive use of some types of pain
medication also may cause stomach ulcers, liver damage and kidney problems.
Treatment
To break the cycle of rebound headaches, you'll need to restrict how much pain medication you use. Depending on
what drug you've been taking, your doctor may recommend stopping the medication right away or gradually reducing
the dose until you're taking the drug no more than twice a week.
Stopping pain medication isn't easy. Expect your headaches to get worse before they get better. You also may
experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, restlessness, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, abdominal pain,
and diarrhea or constipation. But it doesn't last forever. Within a week to 10 days, your headaches may become less
intense and happen less often. With perseverance, most people break the rebound headache cycle within two
months. You may need a bridging medication, something to help alleviate headache pain and the side effects
associated with drug withdrawal. Prednisone is often very effective.

## Before or during withdrawal, you will need to begin a daily preventive medication, such as:


An antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline (Elavil and Pamelor)

An anticonvulsant such as topiramate (Topamax), zonisamide (Zonegran) or valproic acid (Depakote)

A blood pressure medication such as propranolol, metoprolol or verapamil.

Botox injections can be used if multiple oral medications have failed.
Prevention

Avoid migraine triggers.

Keep a headache diary. If you're not sure what triggers your headaches, keep a headache diary. Include
details about every headache. When did it start? What were you doing at the time? What did you eat that
day? How did you sleep the night before? What's your stress level? How long did it last? What, if anything,
provided relief? Eventually, you may begin to see a pattern — and take steps to prevent future headaches.

Get enough sleep. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day — even on weekends. If you're not
tired at bedtime, don't fight it. Read or watch television until you become drowsy and fall asleep naturally.

Don't skip meals. Start your day with a healthy breakfast. Eat lunch and dinner at about the same time
every day. Avoid any foods that seem to trigger headaches.

Exercise regularly. Physical activity causes your body to release chemicals that block pain signals to your
brain. With your doctor's OK, choose activities you enjoy — such as walking, swimming or cycling.  Always
start slowly by warming up and then cool down to prevent exercise-induced headaches.

Reduce stress. Get organized. Simplify your schedule. Plan ahead. When the going gets tough, stay
positive.

Relax. Try yoga, meditation or relaxation exercises. Set aside time to slow down. Listen to music, read a
book or take a hot bath.

Quit smoking. Smoking can trigger headaches or make them worse.

Lose weight.  Recent data suggests that obesity is linked to chronic migraine.
