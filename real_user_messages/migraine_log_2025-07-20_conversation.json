Last night, I went to bed around 10 p.m., a little bit later, because I was watching shows. And I think I woke up once to pee, and then I entered this reminiscence period again, was having trouble to fall back to sleep for a while. And then, I don't know why, because I didn't check the time. And then, the cortisol level was just high, because I'm reminiscing the same thing about David and work, and what I could say things better, that kind of stuff. But I tried to do box breathing, and also tried to just make up stories to distract myself. And I applied a little bit of CBD oil under my tongue to help to relieve the stress and fall back to sleep. Anyway, so I don't know how long I stayed up. After I wake up, I feel like there's a tension on the top right side of my head. And then, I did a little bit of neck drill, and I took the morning dose of anti-reflux medication. And then, half an hour later, I ate my breakfast. And I'll give you a picture later about what breakfast did I eat. It's a cereal. I got it with milk together. And I drank eight ounces plain water, and then I'm drinking my first bottle of electrolyte packet mixed water. I used half of electrolyte packet, and then I already drank 20 ounces of that water.",

Treat while pain is still mild. Gepants such as Ubrelvy (ubrogepant) can “significantly reduce pain within two hours for most people and ease light/sound sensitivity” . Clinical studies — and real-world experience — show they work best when taken early (pain ≤ 3/10) rather than waiting until the headache is entrenched. Label basics for your 50 mg tablets 1 tablet at first sign of migraine. If only partial relief, you may take one more after ≥ 2 h (max 200 mg/day). Keep total use to < 10 days/month to avoid medication-overuse rebound; that rule of thumb applies to most acute migraine drugs . Safety & interactions. Ubrelvy has no cardiac restrictions and low rebound risk , and it’s fine alongside your daily meds. Still, avoid grapefruit within 24 h (slows drug breakdown). Decision lens. Your current pain is rising from 1→2 and you’re early in the attack → taking one 50 mg now fits guidelines and may abort the flare before estrogen-dip day 1 amplifies it. If you’d rather wait, set a ceiling (e.g., pain 4/10 or neck spasm that stops work) so you don’t miss the therapeutic window. Let me know: (a) your exact pain number now (0-10) and (b) whether you dose, so I can log it and keep your monthly Ubrelvy count.

Almonds (nuts) sit on the “use with caution” list because they can liberate histamine in sensitive people. Soy flakes are from plain (un-fermented) soy, so they’re far lower in tyramine than soy sauce or other fermented soy products. Bottom line: your flax-crunch cereal is mostly low-risk; the only moderate amine flag is the almonds. If you notice headaches on heavy-nut days, try capping nuts to one serving and see if tension improves. Amine count watch: With breakfast soy-sauce (+1) and tonight’s cereal almonds (+1), you’re at 2 amine triggers today. That’s still within guidelines (≤1-2/day, ≤4/wk), but log it—if you hit >4 days this week, we’ll run an experiment to see whether lowering amines trims those peri-period headaches.

Last night you shifted bedtime earlier (21:30 vs. 22:00-23:00) but still woke unrefreshed—so both quality and pattern change matter. A micro-experiment: keep bedtime/wake within ±30 min for a week and rate sleep quality (0-10) each morning; see whether migraine frequency tightens. Estrogen drop + caffeine taper = stacked load. Day-1 menses estrogen dip is a well-known sensitizer . Layering caffeine withdrawal and >50 g added sugar can lower your neuronal threshold further. On period days, try holding sugar under 25 g and aim for an extra 8-12 oz electrolyte water—that often blunts the “jelly-head” you noticed.
