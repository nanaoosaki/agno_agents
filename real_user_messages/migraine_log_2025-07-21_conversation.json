A handy way to orient yourself (or your doctor) is to press with one fingertip and note: • Is the tender point on the bony ridge at the base of the skull (typical for occipital-nerve pain) or higher up on the vertex/parietal scalp? • Does turning your head, slouching, or pushing on nearby neck muscles sharpen it? Tight sternocleidomastoids can mimic or trigger occipital pain . Six quick questions to jot down before your next visit: ① Quality – stabbing, electric, dull pressure, or burning? ② Trigger – touch only, or also coughing, brushing hair, prolonged screen time? ③ Radiation – does it shoot behind the eye/ear or stay in a coin-sized spot? ④ Duration pattern – fleeting seconds, minutes, or lingering hours? ⑤ Relief – improves with heat, massage, OTC pain reliever, or lying flat? ⑥ Associated signs – scalp numbness, tingling, visual aura, nausea? Bringing those answers—and noting that your right-sided occipital neuralgia was previously documented —will help the clinician decide whether this new left-sided ache is simple muscle-tension referral, true bilateral nerve irritation, or something entirely different.

A broad, touch-sensitive patch on the crown often reflects myofascial scalp tension or cutaneous allodynia that can shadow a migraine cycle—even when you don’t feel a classic headache. Warm compresses, gentle fingertip kneading around the spot, and staying hydrated usually settle it within a day. To help your clinician sort it out, note this trio over the next 48 h: • Surface changes – redness, bumps, dandruff, or hair-product irritation? • Hair pull test – does lightly tugging hair strands reproduce the ache? • Ponytail or hat tension – does loosening headwear relieve it?

About 95 mg is well below the 200–300 mg threshold that can provoke migraine or reflux in many people. Still, pairing coffee with fried food doubled yesterday’s reflux-trigger count; see if a lower-fat lunch keeps afternoon neck tension quieter. With caffeine and acetaminophen both logged, your tracker can now flag days where those converge—helpful for spotting rebound-risk patterns. Confirm with your clinician before any med changes.",
