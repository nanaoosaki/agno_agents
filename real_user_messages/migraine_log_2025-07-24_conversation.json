I have woke up around 6 a.m. I went to bed at 7 p.m. last night because I had a migraine episode, and then I took a NyQuil, but then I woke up like 11 p.m. last night, and then was having trouble to fall back to sleep. So I took another Unisom to help myself, some CBD oil under the tonge. I don't know, not that it helped. I felt like I didn't sleep at all, but, you know, maybe I'm just half conscious. I woke up probably around 6 a.m. I felt like really tired.",

A quick head-nod or slumped posture during dozing can shorten the SCM/levator pair; when you sit back up, those taut fibers heat up as blood rushes in. Mini-experiment: next time rest in a recliner with a rolled towel supporting the curve behind your mid-neck, set a 10-min timer, then record pain (0-10) on standing. If the flare drops ≥2 points, you’ve found a positional fix (Megahandout p19). • Mid-day physiology. Around 1-2 p.m. cortisol and core temperature dip, vagal tone rises, and vasodilation can feel like “heat” at the neck. Gentle diaphragmatic breaths or a cool gel pack at C2–C5 during rest may blunt that autonomic surge.
