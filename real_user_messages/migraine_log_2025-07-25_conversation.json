      "content": "So it's today's entry. I just verbally talk about everything that happened. I went to bed about 9.30 p.m. last night, and then I had a tension headache going to bed. I ended up having a dose of NyQuil and Ubrella V to treat the tension headache. But then I woke up at some point, I don't know, 1 or 2 a.m., and then I took a Unisom, one to keep sleeping. And today, this morning, I woke up around 6 a.m. When I wake up at 1 or 2 a.m., I felt like there's some kind of pain and tension still remaining on my left side of head. Oh, and also, by the way, I changed to a new pillow. I believe it's slightly taller than my previous pillow. That might be causing the tension on the left side of the neck. And then this morning, when I wake up, clearly, there's still some pain left, probably level 1 on the left side of my temple and top of my head, and the left side of my neck. And then I had my usual breakfast with cereal and one cup of milk. And then I had about, so far right now, it's 4 p.m., I had almost two and a half water bottle, which is in 32 ounces, with electrolyte packet. And my lunch is lamb in the loo leftover from yesterday or two days ago. And then I had a Korean bread, soboro. And then I had a doctor visit between 10 to 11 in the kind of getting examined for my issues again. And then I still have some kind of pain, like dull pain or tightness on the left top side of my scalp. Which is unusual because it's not my migraine site. And then I've been applying slump patches all around my left side of my neck, scapular area, and they all feel kind of painful. But I can function. That's it.",
