Here's why it can still be flagged: Mast cell trigger: Mango contains compounds that may prompt the body to release its own histamine (called histamine liberators), especially in sensitive individuals. Ripeness and storage: Overripe or aged mangoes may accumulate some biogenic amines. Cross-reaction risk: Some people with histamine intolerance also react to other tropical fruits like bananas, papaya, or pineapple, likely due to similar amine-liberating mechanisms. So while not a \"high-amine\" food like aged cheese or cured meat, mango can still act like one in a sensitive system—especially combined with other triggers (like spicy, acidic, or high-sugar foods).

The stretch may have sensitized an already vulnerable occipital/cervical nerve track (see PCP dx: neuralgia + cervicocranial syndrome).Shower (10:30)Warm showers sometimes shift blood pressure or heat-sensitize neck/brainstem pathways. Combined with stretch, could be additive.Reflux/amine lunchStrong candidate: histamine (papaya + mango), tyramine (fish sauce), and capsaicin (chili) all act as delayed migraine triggers (Megahandout p5). Onset 2–3h later fits.Caffeine taperYes—lowering baseline caffeine can provoke instability for a few days, especially in the mid-to-late day (when your body’s used to more). Summary: This migraine likely had multiple contributing layers—the neck stretch may have initiated sensitization, with cardio + heat + high-trigger lunch tipping you over the edge. None alone would necessarily cause a migraine, but the stack likely did. Experiment idea: Try same exercise combo on a low-amine, low-reflux breakfast day, and note if symptoms differ.
