I also just said that when I woke up between 12 to 1, I couldn't fall back to sleep, so I used another 12.5 milligram dose to help sleep. I don't know, I think it took me like two hours to fall back to sleep possibly. And then after waking up, I went to just get a bit of sunlight. At the same time, I finished my first water bottle with electrolyte packet, half of the packet. And before that, I drank about eight ounces of plain water. And then just to avoid mistakes, I actually immediately took the morning supplements, including fish oil, magnesium, and B2. That's it. Right now I feel fine. There's no pain or anything like that.",

In studies, about half of patients cut monthly migraine days by ≥ 50 %. How it works During a migraine, the neuro-peptide CGRP (calcitonin-gene–related peptide) rises and drives pain-inflammation around brain blood vessels. Emgality binds to CGRP itself, blocking the peptide so it can’t activate pain pathways; think of it as “soaking up the extra CGRP before it sets off the alarm.” Where & when to inject It’s a sub-cutaneous (fat-layer) shot—sites with a safe pinch of fat and few vital structures: front thigh, abdomen (2″ from navel), back of upper arm, or upper outer buttock. Rotate spots monthly to avoid soreness; never the neck, which has almost no fat and many important vessels/nerves. Dosing roadmap Loading: two 120-mg pens (240 mg total) on day 1, unless your neurologist chose a 120 mg start. Maintenance: one 120-mg pen every 30 ± 3 days. Setting a standing calendar alert helps. Onset & monitoring Relief can start within the first month, but full benefit may take 2-3 months. Track monthly migraine-day counts to judge effect. Side-effects are usually mild—most often injection-site redness/itch, occasional constipation or mild antibody rash; anaphylaxis is rare but requires ER care. Interactions Emgality is not metabolised by the liver and doesn’t significantly interact with amitriptyline, pantoprazole, or PT treatments, so you can pick whichever calm evening (tomorrow or Wednesday) fits best. Next step Choose your “day 0” (post-PT tomorrow or Wednesday), let the pen warm 30 min, inject, and log the exact time plus any site reaction so we can add it to your tracker.
