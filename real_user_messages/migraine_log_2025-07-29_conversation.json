      "content": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive test that records the brain’s electrical activity from electrodes placed on the scalp. Neurons communicate through tiny voltage changes; when many fire in synchrony, the summed signals can be detected at the surface of the head. How the test works StepWhat happensWhat it means for youPreparationA technician measures your head and marks standard electrode positions (the “10–20 system”). They clean each spot with a mild abrasive gel and affix 16-32 small metal cups with conductive paste or a stretchy cap.No shaving needed; the scrub can feel sandy but shouldn’t hurt.Baseline recordingYou relax with eyes open, then closed, while the computer records background rhythms (alpha, beta, theta, delta).Helps determine your normal resting patterns.Activation proceduresYou may be asked to breathe deeply for 3 min (hyperventilation) and look at a flashing strobe (photic stimulation).These maneuvers can unmask certain abnormalities—especially epilepsy.Event monitoringDuring a routine EEG (~20-40 min) the technologist notes any symptoms (e.g., a stare, limb jerk). In video-EEG, a camera runs continuously to match electrical changes with movements or behaviors.Important if spells are brief or infrequent.Removal & clean-upPaste is wiped away with warm water or acetone pads.You can wash your hair normally afterward. What EEG is used for Epilepsy diagnosis & classification – identifies interictal spikes or seizure onset zones, guiding medication choice, surgical evaluation, or neuro-stimulation. Altered consciousness & coma prognosis – patterns like burst-suppression or reactivity help ICU teams gauge brain function. Sleep disorders – combined with other sensors in polysomnography to stage sleep and detect parasomnias. Encephalopathies – diffuse slowing suggests metabolic/toxic causes; periodic discharges can hint at Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, herpes encephalitis, or post-anoxic injury. Brain death confirmation – a flat (isoelectric) EEG for ≥ 30 minutes is one accepted ancillary test when clinical exam is limited. Types you might hear about ModalityKey featuresTypical durationRoutine scalp EEGStandard office test described above20–40 minSleep-deprived EEGPerformed after staying awake ≥ 24 h40 minAmbulatory EEGPortable recorder worn at home24 h–7 daysVideo-EEG monitoringInpatient unit with continuous EEG + video2–7 daysIntracranial EEG (iEEG)Electrodes surgically placed on/within brainUp to 2 weeks (in epilepsy surgery work-up) Safety & limitations Painless; only skin irritation or mild headache from cap pressure are common. No radiation and no risk of electric shock—the machine only reads signals, it does not send any current into you. Snapshot of function; if no abnormal event occurs during recording, results can be normal even in people with epilepsy. Sometimes repeat or longer studies are needed. Preparing for an EEG Clean, dry hair – skip conditioners or styling products. Take medications as directed unless your neurologist advises holding them. Avoid caffeine or energy drinks for 8–12 h (they can change rhythms). Bring a list of spell descriptions and note the last time you had one. EEG remains one of the most valuable, low-risk windows into real-time brain activity—guiding diagnoses, medications, and sometimes life-saving interventions. This information is educational and not a substitute for personalized medical advice. Always discuss test indications and results with your healthcare provider. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",

Pain stayed at 1 / 10 and slowly migrated to the left temple and scalp. You managed it entirely with non-oral measures: early Salonpas on the right neck, peppermint oil along the hairline, steady 78 oz hydration, and a 2 p.m. PT session that combined heat therapy, TENS, sub-occipital & scapular release, plus band exercises. Additional patches on the left posterior neck and both scapulae quelled lingering tightness. Despite afternoon stress from arguments with Jack, the discomfort never exceeded 1 / 10 and faded to 0 by ~9 p.m., giving a total duration of ~8 hours. No rescue meds were needed, and this occurred on the first day of Emgality loading, suggesting a promising baseline for future comparison. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",
