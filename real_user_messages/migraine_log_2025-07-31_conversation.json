I was solid asleep, probably I gave it a 7. And then getting up, I felt a little lightheadedness, kind of a grogginess for about half an hour. I took my morning antiretrovirals immediately when I got up, it would be 5 30 a.m. And then after that, I did a small contrast therapy, because I feel there was a bit of pain on the rhomboid of my right shoulder, but I believe it's because I was lowering my head, looking for socks and stuff.

Sadness and crying, on the other hand, often activate a more parasympathetic (‘rest-and-digest’) pathway; the tearful release can even calm the nervous system once the moment passes. So it makes sense that the cry didn’t spike pain the way the earlier tension with Jack did. A healthy emotional outlet (tears, talking, journaling) can actually discharge pent-up arousal.

Skipping or delaying single doses makes blood levels wobble and can prolong that adjustment window. Usual early side-effects: dry-mouth and next-morning grogginess are common, especially in the first week; they often fade as your system adapts. These are listed in the handout’s TCA table (dry mouth, sedation) . Reflux? Low-dose amitriptyline doesn’t increase stomach acid; in fact, it’s sometimes used for esophageal sensitivity. Tonight’s reflux bump is more likely from the high-fat, spicy dinner than from the medication itself. Practical take-away Unless your doctor has told you to hold the dose for severe side-effects (e.g., pounding heartbeat, severe dizziness, allergic rash), the usual advice is stay on schedule so the adaptation clock keeps ticking. If morning grogginess or dry-mouth climb higher than today’s 3/5, call your prescriber—they can lower the dose or shift timing. Self-care tweaks for tonight Keep at least 16 oz plain water on the nightstand; a sip on waking eases dry-mouth. Plan your last upright period (a 10-min walk or dishes) to end 30 min after swallowing amitriptyline—this keeps acid down while the pill moves past the stomach. A wedge pillow or 6-in bed riser under the head can also lessen nighttime reflux episodes. Still need How strong is the current reflux “cool/regurgitation” on a 0-5 scale?
