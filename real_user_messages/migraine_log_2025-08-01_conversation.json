The handbook notes that even small shifts away from a regular sleep schedule can fragment sleep and aggravate headache-prone neck muscles. Micro-experiment: For the next three nights, try taking amitriptyline no later than 20:00 again (or slide the bedtime later to keep the same 90-minute gap). Pair this with five minutes of gentle neck stretches before lights-out; note any change in night-wakes and morning neck comfort. A couple of quick clarifications for today: Neck episode: what’s the pain/stiffness level (0-10) now, and has it eased or ended since 05:30? After the 20:30 amitriptyline dose, how were dry-mouth (0-5), motivation (0-5), and appetite (↓ / ↔ / ↑) this morning? Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",

Brief mobility work is shown to decrease neck-related headache intensity when done consistently and with a short warm-up first. Regular exercise—even low-load stretching—also raises the migraine threshold over time. Micro-experiment: Place a sticky note where you keep your evening meds: “20:00 pill ☆ 21:30 stretches.” Keeping that 90-minute amitriptyline–to-bed gap plus a 5-minute nightly neck routine will let you compare sleep continuity and morning stiffness over the next three nights. Two quick checkpoints for today: On a 0-10 scale, what’s the neck stiffness now, and has it eased since stretching?

      "content": "Log saved FieldDetails—(no new data this entry) Reflections Monosodium glutamate (MSG) sits on the “common dietary triggers” list for migraine alongside nitrates, tyramine foods and sulfites. The handout’s diet section also flags bouillon cubes or soup bases made with “autolyzed yeast or MSG” as avoid-if-possible items. For many people it’s the dose × stacking effect that matters: you’d already combined coffee-acid, tomato acid/histamine and citrus, so adding free glutamate may lower the threshold for a headache or reflux flare. A teaspoon of bouillon can carry ~500–700 mg MSG—enough to spike excitatory neurotransmitters in sensitive brains. Fast swaps: Use low-sodium homemade stock, or choose “MSG-free” broth powders. If you need that umami punch, add a splash of coconut aminos or a pinch of nutritional yeast (lower free-glutamate load). Pair tomato dishes with alkaline greens (spinach, kale) to buffer acid if you keep the bouillon. Tracking how you feel 1–6 hours after MSG-containing meals will tell you if it’s a personal red-flag or just a yellow light. Still need for today’s log: Dry-mouth (0-5) on waking.

Sipping water every 15–20 min, chewing sugar-free gum, or keeping a xylitol lozenge by the piano can ease the cotton-mouth and help concentration. Your neck stiffness has stayed mild (1/10) since mid-afternoon, suggesting the stretch-plus-patch combo is containing it well. Keep checking posture while you play and add a brief shoulder roll whenever a piece ends. One quick detail to finish today’s record: • About what time did the right-temple twinge (Migraine E0801C) first appear this morning? Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",

Keep an eye on tomorrow’s sleep quality to see whether the earlier dose restores a smoother night. Dry-mouth 4/5 this morning reminds us that tricyclics commonly cause oral dryness and mild sedation . A bedside water bottle or xylitol lozenge can blunt the cotton-mouth without adding sugar. Micro-experiment: Hold the pill at 20:00 for three consecutive nights. Log tomorrow-morning dry-mouth, motivation, appetite; compare to today’s 4 / 2 / ↑ baseline. Note if sleep length or quality rebounds. Two quick details to finish today’s entry: Roughly what time did this morning’s Migraine E0801C first twinge start? Tomorrow morning, could you jot down your dry-mouth, motivation, and appetite scores after the 20:00 dose so we can see if the timing tweak helps? Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",
