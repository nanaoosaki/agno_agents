      "content": "Hi, here's today's entry. I went to bed at 9 p.m., but I think I drank too much water last night, so I come up to pee around 12 a.m. Couldn't fall back asleep, so I ended up taking 12.5 milligrams of Unisom to help me sleep. And I ended up getting up at 7 a.m., which is probably two hours later than previous nights when I started taking amitriptyline. And then amitriptyline was taken on July 28, so this will be the sixth day to take it. And in previous nights, I did not take Unisom, so I want to make a note of that. This is the first time I combined both amitriptyline and Unisom to fall asleep together. And then I got up at 7 a.m. And then I started to organize the cables. And then I talked with my mom and my brother between 8 to 9. I don't know, it was very annoying to talk to them. They're very nice because they're concerned about my health. But they're trying to tell me things and ask me to do things I don't want to do. I think that caused a little bit of conflict, and there was a tiny bit of pain, level one on my right temple after that. I had my breakfast, which is one cup of cashew-gold cereal and one cup of 1% milk. And then I had only kind of less than 5 grams of coffee today in a pullover style. And then this is my second bottle of water I drink. This is a 32-ounce bottle. And I had an electrolyte bottle in the first one, and then this one is just plain. And between 9.30 to 10.30, I did a 45-minute fitness gaming in Nintendo Switch, just some cardio. And I took my morning supplements around 7.30 AM. And also, I took my anti-reflux medication around 7 AM.",
