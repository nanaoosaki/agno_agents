      "content": "Okay, here's today's entry. I woke up probably around 4 a.m. and then I went to bed about 9 p.m. last night. I had the amitriptyline and then so it's like a straightforward sleep, but I hope I can sleep longer. And then waking up, oh no, it's fine. There's no pain so far. And then I feel like a tiny bit confused, I guess. Oh, not confused, just not in the best state. And then I did a neck exercise a bit. The moment I woke up, I had my antireflux for the morning. And then had my breakfast just a minute ago. Right now it's 5.39 a.m. I feel a bit tired. Today I only have an MRI in the evening. That will be just a thing for today. Water-wise, I had a plain 8-ounce water and then I'm drinking my water with electrolyte packet and it's 60 ounces down.I decided to skip the maintenance inhaler last night because I think the inhaler is causing throat threshing and triphaline is causing dry mouth combined together to make my voice really breaking the next day. So I want to kind of shift it, maybe change the inhaler to a morning dose or lunch dose and then so I can have enough hydration for all the day.",

Gadolinium is a rare-earth metal whose magnetic properties make blood vessels, scar tissue, tumours, and areas of inflammation “light up” on MRI, giving the radiologist sharper detail than a non-contrast scan. About 1 in 3 MRIs use it. The drug is given through a vein, circulates for a few minutes while images are taken, and is then filtered out by your kidneys—~90 % gone in 24 h if kidney function is normal. Very serious reactions are rare (<0.1 %), but people with severe kidney disease are screened because of a condition called NSF. When to expect results Images are available immediately, but a radiologist still has to read them and dictate a report. Urgent or “STAT” scans: preliminary note within a few hours. Routine outpatient scans: 24 – 72 h is typical; some centres quote up to 1-3 business days. Large hospital systems or very busy services may take up to 1–2 weeks unless findings are life-threatening, which are phoned in right away. Watch your patient portal: many practices post the radiologist’s PDF as soon as it’s final; your ordering doctor usually calls after they’ve reviewed it. Next small step: keep drinking water this evening (another 24–32 oz) to help your kidneys clear the GBCA, and jot down when the neck spasm/pain fully resolves so we can close the Episode.
