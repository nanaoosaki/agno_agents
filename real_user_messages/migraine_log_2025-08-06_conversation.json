Magnesium glycinate is well-absorbed and gentle on the gut, while magnesium citrate is more osmotic, so it helps move the bowels but can tip you into loose stools if the total elemental Mg climbs too high. Clinical migraine guidelines cite ≈ 400-600 mg elemental Mg/day—often given as citrate 450-600 mg—to prevent attacks. If you add citrate, start with a half-dose (e.g., 150–200 mg elemental) taken separately from glycinate, then see how both your head and GI tract respond over 2-3 days. Red-flag for diarrhea: the Megahandout lists “diarrhea” as the main side-effect across magnesium salts, including diglycinate (glycinate) and other forms.

Stool moisture depends on fiber + osmotic pull as much as raw fluid. Today’s breakfast had only ~7 g total fiber (Kashi GO 3 g, blueberries 4 g, chia 0.6 g); most adults need ≥ 25 g/day for soft, bulky stool. Eggs and dairy add zero fiber, so consider topping cereal with 1 Tbsp ground flax (2 g fiber) or adding a kiwi or 4–5 prunes mid-morning. Leverage magnesium form. Glycinate is gentle and absorbed into muscle, so it rarely loosens stools. Magnesium citrate is specifically listed as causing loose stools/diarrhea among migraine-friendly salts . Swapping 150-200 mg of your evening glycinate for citrate every other night can draw water into the colon without exceeding the 400–600 mg elemental daily ceiling. Movement matters. A 10-minute brisk walk or two sets of 20 body-weight squats stimulate colonic motility; pair that with your next 16 oz of water. Quick check to finish today’s log: Current right-temple pain (0-10)?

      "content": "Below is a starter “watch-list” drawn from peer-reviewed migraine‐diet handouts and recent elimination-diet guides. Remember: these foods only cause trouble in some people—your own log will tell us which ones matter for you. Fruits that most often act up Tyramine-rich or histamine-rich, especially if over-ripe or dried Avocado Banana (especially speckled or brown) Papaya, pineapple, passion fruit Red or dark plums, prunes, raisins, currants, dates Grapes (sulfites) Citrus (orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime) ➜ keep to ≤ ½ cup juice or 1 whole fruit at a time Raspberries, strawberries, cherries (histamine) Any over-ripe or sulfite-treated dried fruit Vegetables / legumes to be cautious with Tyramine / histamine / nitrite group Tomato & all tomato products Spinach, eggplant, olives Beet, red potato, sweet potato (nitrates/tyramine) Fava or broad beans, snow peas, green peas, navy/pinto/lima beans (if sensitive to tyramine) Onion & garlic (listed on several traditional migraine diets) Sauerkraut, pickles, other fermented/pickled veg Why these come up Tyramine & histamine build up as produce ripens/ferments and can provoke the trigemino-vascular system in susceptible brains. Sulfites & nitrates/nitrites (used to preserve color or occur naturally) can dilate blood vessels or release nitric oxide—another common pathway in migraine. Personal thresholds vary. Many people tolerate small portions—e.g., ½ cup fresh citrus—without issues. How to use the list Eliminate for 2 weeks the items you eat most often. Re-introduce one at a time (e.g., 1 kiwi at breakfast, nothing new for 24 h). Log headache intensity, neck stiffness, and GI changes—your tracker will flag patterns better than any generic list. Good news: flaxseed, kiwi, most lettuces, carrots, zucchini, cucumbers, berries in moderation, and the majority of non-nightshade veggies are usually migraine-safe—and high-fiber choices like kiwi or 1 Tbsp ground flax can also ease constipation without triggering most migraineurs. Always tailor changes with your clinician or dietitian, especially if other conditions (reflux, IBS, kidney issues) are in play. Any of the foods above show up frequently in your own meals? If yes, we can plan a simple A/B test in the log. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",
