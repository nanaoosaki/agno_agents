      "content": "Episode summaries for 2025-08-07 2025-08-07-1 – Left-temple headache after emotional trigger Around noon, following a lunch conversation with Jack that brought up personal and corporate-life tensions, you experienced an emotional surge that triggered a mild (0.5–1) left-temple headache. You napped from 12:30–13:30, which likely provided some emotional and physiological recovery, and the pain remained low-level without progression during this period. No medication was taken for this episode, and it gradually blended into the next tension-related headache later in the afternoon. 2025-08-07-2 – Tension headache progressing toward migraine Around 14:00, you noticed a persistent tension headache, initially mild but with a “tendency to develop into a migraine.” Likely linked to residual emotional tension, you used essential oil along the hairline and applied Slumpus patches to both sides of the skull base, which provided partial relief. By 18:10, with pain beginning to rise, you took Ubrelvy (2nd dose this month), and within 30 minutes the headache was fully resolved. The total duration was about 4 hours 40 minutes, and early abortive therapy likely prevented a full migraine episode. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",
