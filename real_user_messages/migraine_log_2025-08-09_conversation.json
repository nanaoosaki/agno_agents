The pain was consistent with a low-level migraine-type episode or neuralgia overlap, without aura. Relief came following a one-hour nap (13:00–14:00), with no medication required. Some post-nap confusion was noted, which may suggest a postdrome state. Episode 2 – Starting at 4:21 p.m., after about 1.5 hours of watching movies and playing games, a mild tension-type headache developed, focused on the left side. Resting in a dark room and taking 500 mg of acetaminophen at 5:10 p.m. provided full resolution by 5:45 p.m. The screen exposure is a likely trigger; response was effective and prompt. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",
