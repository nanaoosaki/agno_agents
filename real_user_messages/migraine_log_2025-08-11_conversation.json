I got up around, I think, probably 4.30 a.m. or 5.00 a.m. And I went to bed a little bit later than usual, 9.40 p.m. And then I took my trip around 8.20 p.m. It was a little bit later than usual, five minutes later. Sleep was okay, quality probably 7. And then after that, I immediately did a neck stretching exercise because I feel there's some pain on the left trapezius part, the end of the left trapezius near the scapula area. And then I drink so far, right now it's like 9.21 a.m. So far I had a total 40 ounces of water already, 42 ounces mixed with electrolyte packet. I think around the 5.50 a.m. I ate, had the morning anti-reflux medication. And then I'm still skipping the maintenance inhaler. And then I had breakfast, which is one cup of oatmeal with half a cup of 1% milk and probably 40 blueberries. And I had a slice of whole wheat bread for breakfast. And between 8.30 a.m. to 9.10 a.m., I did 40 minutes of Ring Fit. So it's a mix of kind of cardio and kind of strength training. That's it.",

I had two tacos in a cow tortilla. One is a California screaming taco, the other one is a classic taco with tofu, and had some tortilla chips. And then coming back, watch the movies together until 1 p.m., and then I wanted to take a nap. Before that, I had a pretty, kind of, I think my SCM muscle was pulled on the right side, particularly the one next to the skull base, and I ended up using the rice in the socks to heat it by one minute and spray some water to relax it. And then I took a nap, fall asleep, and woke up at 2 p.m. somewhere. I think the tightness is still there of the SCM muscle on the right side. And by the way, there's just constant pain on the left scapula area, trapezius, but I would say it's like a, you know, I do some kind of a relaxation using the stretches. And I did a, oh okay, I want to mention that I did a pretty intense one, a little bit forceful while we were watching a movie. Before I go do a nap, I think that I ended up making the right side of SCM get pulled, so it's like you cannot force it. The warm dollar help, and I took a nap helps. And after the nap, I ate an apple, a Honeycrispy medium-sized apple, and then I've been doing a little bit of piano, and sitting in front of the desk to work on my app, Learning Agent AI. I noticed my voice is a bit like thick and dry. It's possible, I think the dry mouth, there's just not enough saliva. So I ended up, my voice sounded much more thicker than my usual time, I would say. Particularly in the afternoon, maybe. So the dry mouth is bad, probably from the trip that I'm taking. And the neck tightness on the SCM is a little bit less, I think after like it settled a little bit.",
