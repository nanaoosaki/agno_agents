Your clinic handout’s migraine diet lists “Beans: all kinds” on the avoid side (tannins noted as a possible culprit). Reflections Short answer: Yes—lentils (as “beans/legumes”) are on the avoid list in your migraine diet handout; some people react to the tannins in beans. If you want to test it: try a 2-week lentil-free trial, then re-challenge with ½ cup cooked at lunch on a low-trigger day and watch symptoms for 0–48 h. To reduce today’s gas/bloat next time you do try them: stick to a small portion, use well-rinsed canned or well-soaked/cooked lentils, and pair with easy-to-digest sides.

Reflections TL;DR: Green beans = “avoid” per your handout’s “beans: all kinds.” Tofu = not called out; avoid fermented soy (e.g., soy sauce).

Safe use: low–medium heat, 10–15 min, thin cloth barrier, don’t sleep with it, avoid on irritated skin. For actually moving gas: 10–15 min walk, gentle knees-to-chest/wind-relief pose, slow clockwise abdominal self-massage, warm water or ginger (skip peppermint if reflux tends to flare), and simethicone if that’s something you use.

You did PT 10:30–11:30 (neck heat + magnetic therapy, hand therapy, light neck stretches/strengthening), after which the pain “kind of gone.” Episode ended 11:30 Aug 12 (≈23h30m).

It felt worse after dinner, and you applied Salonpas at the left skull base/rhomboid/levator. The separate “left scapular” episode entered at 18:03 was merged into this one.
