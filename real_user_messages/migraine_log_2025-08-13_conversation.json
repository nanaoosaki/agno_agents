Extra histamine in the bloodstream can dilate vessels and irritate trigeminal nerve endings, lowering the brain‚Äôs ‚Äúmigraine threshold.‚Äù HealthlinePMC Other vaso-active compounds ‚Äì Tomatoes are also one of the few veggies with tyramine and plenty of free glutamate; both have been linked to headaches in sensitive brains. Individual variability ‚Äì Only about 20‚Äì30 % of people with migraine react to these foods. Keeping them in your diary lets you see if they line up with attack days for you. So strawberries + tomatoes aren‚Äôt automatic villains, but if they land on the same day as poor sleep or neck tension they can act like the ‚Äúlast straw‚Äù that tips you into an attack. A quick experiment: try a few strawberry-free / tomato-free days while everything else stays the same and watch whether the right-temple flicker still appears. Stretch, deep breath, quick walk?",

If you want caffeine-style numbers to experiment with, start by capping histamine ~50 mg/meal and tyramine ~6 mg/meal for two weeks. Log any migraine or reflux flares; then loosen or tighten as patterns emerge. Use freshness as an easy proxy: the longer a protein sits or ferments, the higher both amines climb.

Heating milk (e.g., 63 ¬∞C √ó 30 min or 72 ¬∞C √ó 15 s) knocks out most bacteria that generate histamine as milk ages. Surveys show pasteurized milk typically sits at 0.3 ‚Äì 0.7 mg histamine / kg, whereas the same volume of raw milk or any fermented dairy can climb 10-fold or more. PMC Raw (unpasteurized) milk isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfresh‚Äù in a migraine sense. Even straight from the farm it carries live microbes that keep producing amines during transport and storage, so the histamine content is unpredictable‚Äîand the food-safety risk is higher. Verywell Health ‚ÄúFresh milk‚Äù on U.S. grocery shelves is almost always pasteurized. Unless the label says ‚Äúraw‚Äù (sold only in a handful of states), the carton you buy‚Äîwhole, 2 %, 1 %, skim‚Äîis pasteurized. Opening it promptly and using it within a few days keeps amine build-up negligible. What about tyramine? Plain milk‚Äîpasteurized or raw‚Äîcontains trivial tyramine (<1 mg/kg). It becomes an issue only once milk is cultured or aged into cheese or yogurt, when certain bacteria convert amino acids into tyramine. PMC Practical take-away If you tolerate milk now, stick with reasonably fresh pasteurized cartons, refrigerate promptly, and you‚Äôre already at the low end of the histamine/Tyramine spectrum‚Äîno special cap like the ‚Äú65 mg caffeine‚Äù rule needed.
