And then later, I start talking, feels like, ugh. And then, I don't know, I didn't have a good sleep. I feel like the quality probably 3 or 4. And then, because the jacket is thick, so we're both a little bit restless for the night. Waking up, there's still pain on my left levator scapula area. The muscles still feel pulled, but it's eased compared to yesterday. And then, after waking up, I did a little bit heat therapy to try to relax the muscle. And then, just a continuous headache, migraines, making me feel a bit confused, less clear. But even so, I did heat therapy, and then breakfast as usual. One cup of cashew cereal, one cup of 1% milk, one fourth cup of blueberries, and one slice of whole wheat bread. And then, yeah.",

He didn't directly shut it down, but made it sound pretty difficult and challenging to really get funds or get it delivered, which is all valid, I think.
