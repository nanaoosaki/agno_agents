I woke up at 3 a.m., went to bed at 9 p.m., and stayed up for probably two hours or so, and then fell back to sleep and got up at 7 a.m. And then I did heat therapy to relax the neck, but the left scapula pain is still there. It's the day 4. I feel like it's less, so I would give it a pain level of 2. And then I had breakfast, which is one cup of cashew gold cereal, one cup of 1% milk, one cup of blueberries, and two slices of whole wheat bread. And then I did a ring fit exercise between 9, 10 a.m. to 9, 30 a.m., 20 minutes.",

Pain is gradually decreasing, rated at a 2/10 today. Heat therapy has been the main self-management method, used both in the morning and before a nap attempt. No specific environmental or postural triggers were reported, and no medications have been used. This appears to be a musculoskeletal issue, possibly related to posture or strain, showing slow but steady improvement. Right Temple Pain Episode A new episode emerged around 2:00 p.m., triggered by intense cognitive focus and frustration from debugging a software issue. The pain was localized to the right temple, rated mildly at 1/10. Relief measures included applying a Salonpas patch and mint essential oil topically. The episode coincided with mental exhaustion and stress but did not escalate. No medications were taken. Current plan is to stop work and prioritize rest to avoid further aggravation.
